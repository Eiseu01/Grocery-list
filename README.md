# GROCERY LIST

So I made this project to practice the dom manipulation, and I saw this in freecodecamp JS project. This project really helps me expand my knowledge in DOM manipulation although the localStorage code in here is from chatGPT since I had hard time doing it but other than that I'm the one who made everything :)

# FUN FACT!
It did take me 4-5 times making to do list since I practice coding and this one is the best, I had hard time before on how to divide the listName, deleteBtn and editBtn, the solution? Grid... ADASADADfewsgDFGOIsdgll!!!!

HI FUTURE ME :3
